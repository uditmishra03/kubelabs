🚫 Limitations of the Default Scheduler

    Generic scheduling logic:

        It’s built to handle general workloads, not specific use cases like GPUs, latency-sensitive apps, or hard node affinity.

    No support for advanced business rules:

        Like prioritizing high-paying tenant workloads over others, or keeping certain services isolated.

✅ Why Use a Custom Scheduler or Multiple Schedulers?
1. Workload Segregation

    Different workloads (e.g., batch jobs vs real-time apps) have different scheduling needs.

    A custom scheduler can prioritize latency for real-time apps and throughput for batch jobs.

2. Special Resource Handling

    For workloads needing GPUs, FPGAs, or other exotic resources, custom logic might be needed.

    Default scheduler might not understand your custom resource types or constraints.

3. Hard Constraints / Custom Rules

    Business-specific rules like:

        “Finance workloads must only run on secure nodes.”

        “No two replicas on the same rack or zone.”

    You can’t always enforce this with taints/tolerations or affinity rules alone.

4. Multi-Tenancy and Isolation

    Each tenant or team can have its own scheduler to avoid stepping on each other.

    Schedulers can enforce quota, priority, and placement policies uniquely per team.

5. Performance Optimization

    A custom scheduler can be built for speed, bin-packing, or cost-awareness.

    The default scheduler doesn’t consider cloud pricing or spot vs on-demand nodes.

6. Scheduling Experiments / Research

    Testing new algorithms (e.g., AI-based scheduling, ML-driven prediction) needs a custom scheduler.

    Useful in academic or experimental environments.

🤖 How It Works

    You run multiple scheduler Pods, each watching for different Pods (based on schedulerName in the Pod spec).

    Example Pod using a custom scheduler:

    spec:
      schedulerName: custom-scheduler

⚠️ Why Not Just Replace the Default?

    Compatibility risks – Default scheduler gets all the updates and bug fixes.

    Complexity – Writing your own scheduler isn't trivial.

    Better to run in parallel – Keep default for regular workloads and route only what you need to the custom one.
